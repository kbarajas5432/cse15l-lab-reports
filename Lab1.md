# Welcome to CS 15L! My name is Karim Barajas and I was a former student of this course. You will enjoy this course and learn more about coding by doing these labs!

** Let's get started by installing VS code ** 
1) When installing the VS code follow the directions clicking on this link and make sure your installment is for the right computer like Windows or Mac: [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2) If you have any questions about the installment ask your professor or tutor, since I already had this program installed before this course
3) Once VS Code is set up, click on the app and you should see this:

** Now let's try remotley conecting **
1) By clicking on this link, you are downloading git but note that this link is for Windows and the computer I am using is Windows: [Link](https://gitforwindows.org/)
2) After downloading, click on this link to follow the instructions to set up your terminal to use git bash in VS Code: [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994)
3) After following the instructions you should see this in your terminal:

4) Before trying any code in the terminal, go to this link and fill in the information because you need to know your couse-specific account for CSE15L: [Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
5) After finding your CSE15L account, click on this link and follow the directions to reset your password for that account, unless the instructor says no.: [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17IDZn8Qq7Q0RkYMxdiIR0o6HJ3B5YqSW/view)
6) When you are done resetting, head on back to VS Code and write this in your terminal and click enter, but the part with zz, just replace it with your two given letters of your account: `ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
7) Since this might be your first time inputting that specific code, you may get a prompt with a yes/no at the end, which all you need is just type yes and press enter
8) Your terminal will then prompt you to type your account password and just note that when writing your password, it will not be shown in the terminal but whatever you wrote is there, but just hidden from view
9) When you are done writing your password and clicking enter, you should see this:

10) Once you see that, it means that your computer is connected :)

** Lastly, let's now run some commands **
1) Here are the commands you can try for your terminal: 
- `cd ~`
- `cd`
- `ls -lat`
- `ls -a`
- `ls <directory>` but replace `<directory>` with `/home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/cs15lsp23abc` and also replace `abc` with your group members' username
- `cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt ~/`
- `cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt`
2) I tried all of them and they looked like this:

3) When running each code, observe what they do
