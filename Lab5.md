1. Debugging Post
- The enviroment that I am using is VSCode in my Windows laptop
- When I was running the code by Junit, I saw that two out of the three tests in my Methods Test failed. The first tested exped another number for the assert part and the second test noted that the index was out of bounds.Before I even ran Junit, I thought that everthing should run perfectly and I even wrote down the numbers that I expected for `assertEquals`.
