# Lab Report 4
FOr this report, I will reproduce steps 4-9 of the week 7 lab, which in this case will be numbered 1-6.

1. Logging in to ieng6:
- keys pressed: `ssh` `<space>`, `cs15lsp23jl@ieng6.ucsd.edu` `<enter>`
- Running that command prompted me to type in my password. Write your password but note that it will not appear in terminal since it is hidden when you type. I am not going to write it here for obvious reasons. After the password write in, just click <enter>.
- After that, you should see some sort of welcome message and it also shows the last time that you logged in.

 2. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
  - keys pressed: `git clone` `<space>` `https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7` `<enter>`
  - This just basically clones the link to your cs15l account. By cloning this, you can do the commands that are being asked for the lab.
